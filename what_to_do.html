</div>

<div class="gallery">

<div class="item">
	<img src="images/mt_baldy.jpg" alt = "View from Mount Baldy"/>
	<h2>Mount Baldy</h2>
	<p>If you're visiting in the winter, Mount Baldy is a popular skiing spot. If you're visiting during any other time of the year, you can still enjoy the chair lift ride that takes you to the very top where you can see the valleys underneath. You can even get a glimpse of the famous Catalina Islands in the distance. Mount Baldy is a great spot to get a feel of the Southern California landscapes.</p>
</div>


<div class="item">
	<img src="images/temple.jpg" alt="Photo of Hsi Lai Temple"/>
	<h2><a href="http://www.hsilai.org/">Hsi Lai Temple</a></h2>
	<p>About 20 miles from Downtown L.A, this Chinese temple sits atop a hill in the beautiful city of Hacienda Heights and is a must visit. If the location isn't enough to entice you, the Hsi Lai Temple holds a number of events open to anyone. Have some tea, learn about Buddhist and Chinese History, and marvel at the ancient inspired architecture. And of course if you hold the belief, you can pray inside the temple. You'll forget you're still in California.</p>
</div>

<div class="item">
	<img src="images/samo.jpg" alt = "Photo of Santa Monica Pier at Night"/>
	<h2 >Santa Monica Pier</h2>
	<p>Santa Monica is one of the most visited beaches in Los Angeles. Take a walk on the pier, ride the ferris wheel, watch some fishing, or enjoy the talens of a variety of street performers. There are also plenty of restaurants right on the pier. One can easily spend an entire evening at this beloved boardwalk.</p>
</div>


<div class="item">
	<img src="images/venice.jpg" alt = "Photo of Venice Canals"/>
	<h2>Venice Canals</h2>
	<p>Get a feel for what it's like to be in Venice, Italy while also touring L.A. The city of Venice Beach (appropriately named so) is home to a series of man-made canals right between houses. The small bridges and locally owned canoes and gondolas add to the Instagram worthiness of this little California beach town.</p>
</div>


<div class="item">
	<img src="images/dtla.jpg" alt="View from the InterContinental Building rooftop"/>
	<h2>InterContinental Building</h2>
	<p>This luxury hotel and resort owned by Korean Air is a great place to have a few drinks while enjoying the Downtown Los Angeles lights. Admire the interesting artwork inside the building while you make your way to the top of this high riser.</p>
</div>

<div class="item">
	<img src="images/laguna_beach.jpg" alt="Photo of Laguna Beach"/>
	<h2>Laguna Beach</h2>
	<p>Laguna Beach is one of the most beautiful and quaint beaches in Southern California. It offers a perfect combination of a floral and tropical landscape. Geology enthusiasts might also like the rock formations and hidden coves scattered throughout the coast-line.</p>
</div>

<div class="item">
	<img src="images/getty_center.jpg" alt="View from the Getty Center"/>
		<h2><a href="http://www.getty.edu/">Getty Center</a></h2>
	<p>A train ride up a mountain in West L.A takes you to another popular spot to get a daytime view of the L.A landscape. Families like to bring their kids for picnics or to participate in cultural events. The museum itself is free and hosts one of the world's largest art collections <cite>(source: getty.edu)</cite>. While parking costs $10, the ticket is also valid for their sister location Getty Villa in Malibu if you visit same day. The Getty Villa also has it's own art collection which is inside...you guessed it, a villa with a view of Malibu beach.</p>
</div>

<div class="item">
	<img src="images/dockweiler.jpg" alt="Photo of roasting marshmallows on a Dockweiler Beach bonfire"/>
	<h2>Dockweiler Beach</h2>
	<p>While you may not find the beach itself the most spectacular, it's lined with a number of bonfires. California beaches can get chilly during the evening and there aren't a lot of beaches where you can enjoy a nice fire and freshly toasted smores while enjoying a nice cool sea breeze.</p>
</div>



<div class="item">
	<img src="images/long_beach.jpg" alt="Photo Palm Trees Lined in Long Beach"/>

Behold the site of the <a href="https://www.queenmary.com">Queen Mary</a>. Another great place to visit, <a href="http://www.aquariumofpacific.org">The Aquarium of the Pacific</a> (ticketed) is a recommended attraction for kids. There are also plenty of shopping options in the area and several spots to relax and abord the atmoshpehere of a harbor town.</p>
